# Python Programming Essentials - Summer Training Tasks

## Project Overview
This repository contains solutions and practice scripts developed during the "Python Programming Essentials: From Basics to Beyond" summer training program. The tasks cover various fundamental and advanced Python concepts.

## Contents
This repository includes Python scripts for the following tasks:

* `task1_student_report_card.py`: A simple program to generate student report cards.
* `task3_library_management_oop.py`: An object-oriented program for managing library books.
* `task7_simple_calculator.py`: A basic calculator application with function and exception handling.
* `task8_contact_book.py`: A contact book application using Python dictionaries.
* `task9_numpy_operations.py`: Demonstrates fundamental operations using the NumPy library.
* (Add any other files you have, e.g., `Data_Analysis.py`, `fact.py`, `p1.py`, etc., with a brief description for each)

## Setup and Running the Code

### Prerequisites
* Python 3.x installed (preferably within a virtual environment).
* `pip` (Python package installer).
* For `task9_numpy_operations.py` (and potentially `Data_Analysis.py`), you need:
    ```bash
    pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn
    ```

### How to Run
1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/YourUsername/Python_Summer_Tasks.git](https://github.com/YourUsername/Python_Summer_Tasks.git)
    cd Python_Summer_Tasks/TASK
    ```
    (Replace `YourUsername` and `Python_Summer_Tasks` with your actual GitHub details)

2.  **(Optional but Recommended) Create and activate a Virtual Environment:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv .venv
    .\.venv\Scripts\Activate   # On Windows PowerShell
    # source .venv/bin/activate # On Linux/macOS
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn
    ```

4.  **Run individual scripts:**
    ```bash
    python task1_student_report_card.py
    python task9_numpy_operations.py
    # etc.
    ```

## Learning Journey
This project helped me learn:
* Basic Python syntax and control flow.
* Functions and exception handling.
* Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts.
* Working with built-in data structures (lists, dictionaries, etc.).
* Introduction to scientific computing with NumPy.
* (Add other key learnings based on your experience)
